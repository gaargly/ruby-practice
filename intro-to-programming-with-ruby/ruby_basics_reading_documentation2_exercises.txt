1. How would you use String#upcase to create an uppercase version of the string "xyz"?

"xyz".upcase

2. Assume you have this Array:

a = %w(a b c d e)

How would you use Array#insert to insert the numbers 5, 6, and 7 between the elements with values 'c' and 'd'?

a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)

3. Assume you have the following code:
inspect → string
Returns a printable version of self, enclosed in double-quotes, and with special characters escaped
inspect → split(field_sep = $;, limit = nil)
If limit is positive integer n, no more than n - 1- splits occur, so that at most n substrings are returned, and trailing empty substrings are included:

What will each of the 3 puts statements print?

s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'

puts s.split.inspect

["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]
=> nil

puts s.split(',').inspect

["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]
=> nil

puts s.split(',', 2).inspect

["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]

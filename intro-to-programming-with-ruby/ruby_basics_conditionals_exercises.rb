# 1. In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.

if sun == "visible"
  puts "The sun is so bright!"
end

# 2. Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals 'visible'.

unless sun == "visible"
  puts "The clouds are blocking the sun!"
end

# 3. Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals visible. Also, write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals visible.
# When writing these statements, take advantage of Ruby's expressiveness and use statement modifiers instead of an if...end statement to print results only when some condition is met or not met.

puts "The sun is so bright!" if sun == "visible"
puts "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun == "visible"

# 4. In the code below, boolean is randomly assigned as true or false.

boolean = [true, false].sample

# Write a ternary operator that prints "I'm true!" if boolean equals true and prints "I'm false!" if boolean equals false.

boolean ? puts("I'm true!") : puts("I'm false!")

# 5. What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.
# ANSWER: My favorite number is 7.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# 6. In the code below, stoplight is randomly assigned as 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

# Write a case statement that prints "Go!" if stoplight equals 'green', "Slow down!" if stoplight equals 'yellow', and "Stop!" if stoplight equals 'red'.

case stoplight
  when "green"
   puts "Go"
  when "yellow"
   puts "Slow down!"
  when "red"
   puts "Stop!"
end

# 7. Convert the case statement to an if statement.

if stoplight == "green"
  puts "Go"
elsif stoplight == "yellow"
  puts "Slow down!"
elsif stoplight == "red"
  puts "Stop!"
end

# 8. In the code below, status is randomly assigned as 'awake' or 'tired'.

status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

# Write an if statement that returns "Be productive!" if status equals 'awake' and returns "Go to sleep!" otherwise. Then, assign the return value of the if statement to a variable and print that variable.
alert =
  if status == "awake"
     "Be productive!"
  else
    "Go to sleep!"
  end

puts alert

# 9. In the code below, number is randomly assigned a number between 0 and 9. Then, an if statement is used to print "5 is a cool number!" or "Other numbers are cool too!" based on the value of number.

number = rand(10)

if number = 5
  puts '5 is a cool number!'
else
  puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
end

# Currently, "5 is a cool number!" is being printed every time the program is run. Fix the code so that "Other numbers are cool too!" gets a chance to be executed.

# My modified code

if number == 5
  puts '5 is a cool number!'
else
  puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
end

# 10. Reformat the following case statement so that it only takes up 5 lines.

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

# my reformatted code
case stoplight
  when 'green' then puts 'Go!'
  when 'yellow' then puts 'Slow down!'
  else                puts 'Stop!'
end

# 1. In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

# Select 'fish' from pets, assign the return value to a variable named my_pet, then print the value of my_pet.

my_pet = pets[2]
puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"

# 2. Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string.

my_pets = [pets[2], pets[3]] # OR my_pets = pets[2..3]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"

# 3. Remove 'lizard' from my_pets then print the value of my_pets.

my_pets.pop
puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]}!"

# 4. Without changing the code below, select 'dog' from pets, add the return value to my_pets, then print the value of my_pets.

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
my_pets = pets[2..3]
my_pets.pop

my_pets << pets[1]
puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"

# 5. In the code below, an array containing different types of colors is assigned to colors.

colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green']

# Use Array#each to iterate over colors and print each element.

colors.each { |color| puts "I'm the color #{color}!" }

# 6. In the code below, an array containing the numbers 1 through 5 is assigned to numbers.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use Array#map to iterate over numbers and return a new array with each number doubled. Assign the returned array to a variable named doubled_numbers and print its value using #p.

doubled_numbers = numbers.map { |num| num * 2 }
p doubled_numbers

# 7. In the code below, an array containing five numbers is assigned to numbers.
numbers = [5, 9, 21, 26, 39]

# Use Array#select to iterate over numbers and return a new array that contains only numbers divisible by three. Assign the returned array to a variable named divisible_by_three and print its value using #p.

divisible_by_three = numbers.select {|num| num % 3 == 0 }
p divisible_by_three

# 8. The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with the number following it by placing the pair in their own array. Then create a nested array containing all three groups. What does this look like? (You don't need to write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it meets the exercise requirements.)

['Dave', 7, 'Miranda', 3, 'Jason', 11]
[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# 9. In the code below, a nested array containing three groups of names and numbers is assigned to favorites.

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# Flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result should not have any subarrays, but should have all of the original strings and numbers from the original array:

puts favorites.flatten

# 10. In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two variables, array1 and array2.

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

# Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.

puts array1 == array2

# 1. Inherited Year
# Using the following code, create two classes - Truck and Car - that both inherit from Vehicle.

class Vehicle
  attr_reader :year

  def initialize(year)
    @year = year
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle
end

class Car < Vehicle
end

truck1 = Truck.new(1994)
puts truck1.year

car1 = Car.new(2006)
puts car1.year

# 2. Change the following code so that creating a new Truck automatically invokes #start_engine.

class Vehicle
  attr_reader :year

  def initialize(year)
    @year = year
    start_engine
  end

  def start_engine
    puts 'Ready to go!'
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle

end

truck1 = Truck.new(1994)
puts truck1.year

# 3. Using the following code, allow Truck to accept a second argument upon instantiation. Name the parameter bed_type and implement the modification so that Car continues to only accept one argument.

class Vehicle
  attr_reader :year, :bed_type

  def initialize(year, bed_type=nil)
    @year = year
    @bed_type = bed_type
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle
end

class Car < Vehicle
end

truck1 = Truck.new(1994, 'Short')
puts truck1.year
puts truck1.bed_type

car1 = Car.new(2006)
puts car1.year
puts car1.bed_type

# 4. Given the following code, modify #start_engine in Truck by appending 'Drive fast, please!' to the return value of #start_engine in Vehicle. The 'fast' in 'Drive fast, please!' should be the value of speed.

class Vehicle
  def start_engine
    'Ready to go!'
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle
  def start_engine(speed)
    super() + " Drive #{speed}, please!"
  end
end

truck1 = Truck.new
puts truck1.start_engine('fast')


# 5. Using the following code, create a Towable module that contains a method named tow that prints I can tow a trailer! when invoked. Include the module in the Truck class.

module Towable
  def tow
    puts "I can tow a trailer!"
  end
end

class Truck
  include Towable
end

class Car
end

truck1 = Truck.new
truck1.tow

# 6. Using the following code, create a class named Vehicle that, upon instantiation, assigns the passed in argument to @year. Both Truck and Car should inherit from Vehicle.

module Towable
  def tow
    'I can tow a trailer!'
  end
end

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :year

  def initialize(year)
    @year = year
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle
  include Towable
end

class Car < Vehicle
end

truck1 = Truck.new(1994)
puts truck1.year
puts truck1.tow

car1 = Car.new(2006)
puts car1.year

# 7. Using the following code, determine the lookup path used when invoking cat1.color. Only list the classes that were checked by Ruby when searching for the #color method.

class Animal
  attr_accessor :color

  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
end

cat1 = Cat.new('Black')
puts Cat.ancestors


# 8. Using the following code, determine the lookup path used when invoking cat1.color. Only list the classes and modules that Ruby will check when searching for the #color method.

class Animal
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
end

cat1 = Cat.new("tabby")
# cat1.color This is not working
puts Cat.ancestors

# 9. Using the following code, determine the lookup path used when invoking bird1.color. Only list the classes or modules that were checked by Ruby when searching for the #color method.

module Flyable
  def fly
    "I'm flying!"
  end
end

class Animal
  attr_reader :color

  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
end

class Bird < Animal
  include Flyable
end

bird1 = Bird.new('Red')
bird1.color
puts Bird.ancestors

# 10. Create a module named Transportation that contains three classes: Vehicle, Truck, and Car. Truck and Car should both inherit from Vehicle.

module Transportation
  class Vehicle
  end

  class Truck < Vehicle
  end

  class Car < Vehicle
  end
end
